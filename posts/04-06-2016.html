        	<p class="paragraph">This post is the 3rd part of a series on overlooked managers of the last decade. Part one and two focused on Unai Emery and Francesco Guidolin - Leonardo Jardim is the newest addition. All information has been personally collected and contextualised, though exact data from lower divisions could be a bit off.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="heading1">Managerial Information</p>

		<p class="heading2">Camacha (2003-2008)</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Starting his managerial career at only 29, Leonardo Jardim took over AD Camacha for the 2003/04 season after two years as assistant manager. Gaining context into his time there is difficult. The league (3rd tier of Portuguese football) changed from regional to random groups, from three different divisions to four, from three automatic relegation places to four then to eight, and finally from 38 matches to 26.</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Anyway, looking at the information available (points per game, goals scored, goals against, final position) Camacha seemed to have a good time under Jardim. The season before he signed, the Portuguese side finished 11th (of 20) with 1.34 points per game (ppg), 1.37 goals for per game (gfpg) and 1.39 goals against per game (gapg). Leonardo Jardim's first season saw a 10 point rise under the same league conditions, moving from 11th to 5th. With 1.61 ppg, 1.45 gfpg and 1.21 gapg, each aspect had a fair improvement. As well as this, the young manager led AD Camacha to their 5th trophy in their history with an AF Madeira Cup. This is a regional cup, usually dominated by top flight teams Maritimo, Uniao da Madeira and Nacional da Madeira who have taken the trophy in 51/70 seasons. The second season, while still better than the year before he took over, saw a decline of 8 points and down to 8th for the season.</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">The following year (2005/06) switched from three regional leagues of 20 teams to four randomly selected divisions of 14. Camacha finished 3rd with 1.62 points per game, 1.81 goals per game (most in the division) and 1.12 goals against per game. The 2006/07 season was similar – final league position of 3rd, 1.73 ppg, 1.62 gfgp and 1.04 gapg. Jardim's final season was again in a newly structured division. Finishing 9th with 1.5 ppg, 1.35 gfpg and 1 gapg, Camacha were placed in the relegation battle group. This group was for over half the division (8/14 teams), of which Camacha won to remain in the division. The club were maybe a little unfortunate to finish so low originally too – 5th highest goal difference and only 5 points off 3rd compared to 16 points clear of 3rd from bottom. Despite winning the relegation group, for some reason (which I can't find online and Jardim has himself since complained about) the next season (after Jardim left) was played in the 4th tier of Portuguese football. They won the division by 13 points.</p>
		
		<p class="heading2">Chaves (2008-2009)</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Joining after Chaves finished 4th of 14 teams in the 3rd tier of Portuguese football, Leonardo Jardim improved the points per game from 1.69 to 2 resulting in a division title. Jardim achieved promotion back to the 2nd tier after the club had two unsuccessful attempts. His stay only lasted a year as Beira-Mar of the second tier contacted him about being their new boss. After his departure Chaves were relegated back to the 3rd tier where they remained for the next three seasons.</p>
		
		<p class="heading2">Beira-Mar (2009-11)</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Beira-Mar reportedly made it clear to Jardim that his job was to take the club back to the top flight where they had spent all but 4 of the previous 39 seasons. The 2008/09 season was a disaster for  Beira-Mar. Not only did they finish 12th of 16 teams in the 2nd tier (7 points worse and 6 places below the previous season), it was also the first time since the start of the 70's in which they had to play two consecutive non-top flight seasons. Coming in at the club's worst point in 40 years with demands of promotion is quite unusual. Jardim succeeded instantly, guiding Beira-Mar back to Portugal's Primeira Liga with a second flight league title win. In the 30 matches played they improved by 19 points, scored 12 more goals and conceded 2 fewer than in 08/09.</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Leonardo Jardim's first season as a manager of a top flight football club came at 36 years old. Set with the task of keeping Beira-Mar in the division, the Portuguese manager achieved the goal relatively easily. Usually floating around mid-table, they never once dropped into the relegation zone and were often closer to a European qualification place. Jardim left the club suddenly toward the end of the season; he has since claimed this was as a result of continual disagreements with the owners. Following his resignation Beira-Mar dropped from 10th to 13th - their lowest point that season. The points total and goal difference ended higher than Beira-Mar have achieved in any other season in the 21st century.</p>
		
		<p class="heading2">Braga (2011-12)</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Until this point I haven't really mentioned Jardim's cup record, mostly because finding data on lesser cups and their specific years is quite inconsistent. Some sites say the club reached the last 16, others say 2nd round and both have the team going out to different teams. The other reason has been the fact there just hasn't been much to say. Generally he's done about as well as in previous years, occasionally getting unlucky pulling out top flight teams with his 2nd flight team. At Braga their cup record is quite interesting. Given the fact Porto and Benfica have dominated the league for a long time, their attention to cups has been quite telling. Since 2000 they have reached 3 finals, 4 semi-finals and 2 quarter-finals from the 14 domestic cup attempts. Jardim again did pretty average – getting through the group stage of the Europa League/UEFA Cup for the 4th time in their history, though these have all been in the last 10 years. Jardim reached the semi-final of the weaker cup but only the last 32 of the main cup.</p>
		
		<p class"paragraph">His one season at Braga saw the club finish in their highest place for 6 seasons (3rd) and their 2nd highest ever. With the 62 points (2.07 per game) this was the most the club achieved in the 6 years too. The goal difference of +30 was the highest in the club's history of top flight football. The improvement from the previous season was an impressive 16 points and the season after he left fell 10 points. Similarly the goal difference increased by 18 then fell by 14 after his departure. The transfers made in this season were in line with the model Braga seem to follow – sell high, spend little, and develop their own youth players to eventually sell. Jardim's season saw the club receive their highest transfer profit until the 2015/16 season (£13.5m).</p>

		<p class="heading2">Olympiakos (2012-Jan 2013)</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Despite being unbeaten after 17 games and comfortably top of the league in January, still in the domestic cup and with a decent Champions League campaign, the Portuguese manager was sacked. This wasn't a decision based on football. The president and manager reportedly had big personal problems resulting in him being let go. The groundwork didn't go to waste; 2.65 points per game fell to 2.46 and the club were surprisingly knocked out to Levante in the last 32 of the Europa League, though the title and domestic cup were still won. Again, points per game in the league increased under Jardim and declined the season after he left.</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">The second question mark of Leonardo Jardim's career was brought up in this season with Olympiakos – his personality. After apparently falling out with Beira-Mar's staff/president, then with Braga's owner to the extent of resigning after one year and then again at Olympiakos, this seems to be a problem. A few other coaching issues and managerial arguments have surfaced over the years too. Obviously this isn't make-or-break for a manager, even the best fall out with clubs – Guardiola sacked all his medical staff a year ago, and hardly a day goes by that Mourinho isn't arguing with someone. It is a question mark for clubs looking to hire a long term boss though.</p>

		<p class="heading2">Sporting Lisbon (2013-14)</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Jardim's only season at Sporting Lisbon was a success. Coming in after a 6th place finish he guided the club to a shock 2nd place finish, becoming the first team aside from Benfica or Porto to finish in the top-2 in 4 years. This was a 25 point increase on the season before despite only spending £3m and making more money in the transfer market (£18.5m profit) than any other season to date. Sporting Lisbon dropped below Porto into 3rd the season after Jardim left the club, though the points per game increased again 9. This trend has since continued under Jorge Jesus after a serious title push in the 2015/16 season. The young players since Jardim's time, like William Carvalho, have continued to push on. Developing young players has been a trend throughout his career. This aspect of his coaching is likely to have been a big factor in getting him his next job – Monaco.</p>
		
		<p class="heading2">Monaco (2014-2016)"<p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">The situation at Monaco was quite unique when Jardim took over. The £120mil spent in the previous year was beginning to move in a different direction. £66mil pairing James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao were moved on and, of the money made on transfers, only a small amount was allowed to be reinvested – this was spent exclusively on young players. Unsurprisingly this resulted in a 9 point reduction and a drop in league position from 2nd to 3rd. Most impressively for the 2014/15 season was the Champions League campaign. Pulling out three similar level teams in the group – Leverkusen, Zenit and Benfica, Jardim came out 1st. Arsenal were pulled out and defeated in the last 16, then future finalists Juventus came out as one-goal winners in a tight quart-final.</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Last season again saw a crazy transfer window. Falcao was again loaned out and an additional £120mil's worth of players were let go. £70mil was reinvested in youth prospects with only £8mil going on over 23 year olds. Again, unsurprisingly, they lost 6 points on the previous season, but managed to keep their 3rd place finish. The cups were a bit of a disaster with almost no run in any of the four attempted. It's a strange situation to be in now. The club seems to have accepted PSG are unreachable, which is realistic really. The investment has dried up and it's hard to tell how much will be spent year-on-year after sales. The model now is to develop players then move them on for a profit. How happy with that situation will Jardim be? I'm not sure, but I'd be confident he could be persuaded by a more ambitious club.</p>

		<p class="heading1">Tactically</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">The only real consistency of Leonardo Jardim's formation approach seems to be the four at the back. At Monaco, Sporting, Olympiakos and Braga his teams have all changed formation and personnel but the four at the back remains. While open to 4-4-2 with a flat or diamond midfield, the Portuguese coach has predominantly played either a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3.<p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">His first season at Monaco saw plenty of experimentation – at times a deeper defensive block looking to counter, then a higher pressing team and eventually (probably due to Berbatov not being effective at either) they settled somewhere in-between. The 4-2-3-1 was more prominent in important games, Jardim preferring the 4-4-2/4-4-1-1 shape it allowed defensively. In attack this often rotated to a 4-3-3 with the wide players in Carrasco/Martial/Ocampos and Dirar/Carrasco/Bernardo Silva providing the counter attacking outlet ball. Moutinho didn't have a great season for large parts and Berbatov only really had glimpses throughout. Both looked shoehorned in as the big names with moments of genius, though from the games I've revisited both seemed to cause the most tactical problems for Jardim. Their defensive record against tougher opposition was excellent despite the problems and generally they found a way to make the attack functional. As a structure it was an impressive side. It differed from the league system which shows flexibility as well as an understanding of when to be realistic with a difficult match.</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Jardim spoke during his season at Sporting on the importance of stopping teams attacking through the middle of the pitch. Generally he set up with them in a 4-3-3 shape looking to press with a high-line and a man-oriented system in central midfield. This has also been the case at Monaco. Against Arsenal, Leverkusen and Benfica in his first season he'd often have the attacking midfield marking/blocking passes to the defensive midfielder. Usually Moutinho out of possession stood with the central midfielder tasked with bring the ball out of defence, and then when the situation arose he was the pressing instigator. Similarly in these matches counter attacks were prevented by any means - centre backs getting tight and giving small fouls to break up play, midfielders pulling players back, or even just the structured approach of forcing the opposition into wide areas initially until the defensive shape was back in position. While seemingly not the most important notes, it does give an indication into what Jardim finds important defensively – compactness, making opposition teams pass long or out wide from defence, forcing the opposition into crossing, frustrating them into long shots and to prevent counter attacks. I'd argue that at face value each of these steps makes a lot of sense defensively.</p>

        </div>

		<p class="paragraph">So, if he's acknowledged this from a defensive point of view, surely he pushes his teams to not make the same mistakes offensively?</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">Long shots in Ligue 1 Monaco had the least in the division in 2015/16 and only 0.2 more per game in 2014/15. Preferring shot quality over shot quantity gives one tick to consistency in his approach. How about crossing? Monaco have averaged about the 3rd most crosses per game over the last two seasons, which is quite strange  given Jardim acknowledging the lower percentage chances they offer. What should be noted is the style of cross. Low cut-backs and drilled crosses are heavily favoured to floated balls or deep crosses. Monaco have a surprisingly low possession average (under 50% despite finishing 3rd) compared to the high opposition 3rd possession (3rd in the league). This suggests getting the ball forward quickly is more important to him. This goes in line with the logic of counter attacking and not letting defences settle into compact shapes.</p>
		
		<p class="heading1">Overall</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">There are very few many managers who have gone under the radar despite being successful at relatively big teams quite like Jardim in the last five seasons. Speaking multiple languages, playing different styles, meeting expectations of differing degrees in changing financial environments – there just aren't many managers about with such a complete skillset. Yes, his personality is a concern for long-term plans. And yes, his cup record is a little shaky so far. But all things considered, his success for a 41 year old manager is incredible. He has worked his way through the bottom divisions to the top, tested himself abroad and made a statement with a combative Champions League display. Given the fact Monaco's ambition has been in limbo for a 3rd straight season I can't really see him looking to stay for much longer. A top club needs to look past his age, understand his achievements and take a leap of faith. I'm confident it'll pay off.</p>
