            <p class="paragraph">As a long serving (and seemingly the only) member of the "Mustafi for £20 mil is crazy" club, I've decided to put my argument across now that Arsenal are on the back of an 11-game unbeaten run with the German. Primarily because the fee eventually increased to a bizarre £35 mil, way above the initial cost I laughed off, but also because the universal praise seems to be down to results rather than performances.</p>

        <p class="heading1">The Good</p>

        <p class="heading2">Passing</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Mustafi is a solid passer – generally he goes forward, tries to break lines and is willing to take risks. Very important in teams with centre backs seeing a lot of the ball, like Arsenal or Valencia. I'd argue this is his biggest strength. While also prone to the odd game where he tries too hard to build play, I'll take that every time over a defender who plays simple sideways passes for 90 minutes. Generally in possession he's happy to step into midfield and look to play vertically. Maybe not a regular line breaker like Hummels or Bonucci, though it's still positive and quick.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Under pressure hens composed, understands where to move to help teammates and the selection of pass is mostly good.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Defending Wide Spaces</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Bellerin's main weakness is 1-v-1 defending. It was important the right-sided central defender coming in to help Arsenal was someone willing to double up or just sweep the right side when the young fullback is positioned high up. Although maybe a little too eager to move away from the middle, Mustafi definitely ticks both boxes. Every game he makes several wide tackles/interceptions and does a solid job doubling up on the opposition's winger.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Aggressive slide tackles to win possession down the right side has been a common theme in his early Arsenal career, something Mertesacker and Gabriel don't really offer (for very different reasons). Playing right back on occasion throughout his career probably helps Mustafi here. As mentioned he can be overly willing to move away from central defence to help Bellerin, though this isn't exclusive to the right side. We'll get to that now…</p>

        <p class="heading1">The Bad</p>

        <p class="heading2">Aggression and Positioning</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The most glaring weakness in Mustafi's game is the one he gets so much praise for – being on the front foot. Yes, he makes lots of interceptions and tackles - that's what happens when you rush out of defence all the time. What these stats don't tell you is the negative impact it has when the ball isn't won and a space in defence is created.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Balance is vital for ‘front-foot' defenders – you have to know when to get tight and when to drop. Koscielny is a good example of a ‘front-foot' defender doing it right. His judgement of when to press and stick rarely gets Arsenal into danger and yet he also stacks up the interceptions each season. A hole in the middle of your defence is such an obvious weakness and yet it's almost always ignored during mainstream analysis.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Anticipation of the Interception</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Mustafi's over eagerness to win the ball ahead of the striker can change a routine piece of hold-up play into an attacker running directly at the defence. It's something really basic yet so important. Not only does it turn a (mostly) harmless attack into a dangerous one, it can also catch the rest of the defence unaware. Players have to be well positioned to recover and switched on enough to fill the hole Mustafi's vacated. This isn't major in a high line with lots of recovery space, but Mustafi is prone to do this in deep areas too.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Bouncing Balls</p>

        <p class="paragraph">An obscure note I had while watching Mustafi at Valencia was how he judges bouncing balls. There is so much hesitation. It's a really strange criticism but can result in a big defensive error, as Arsenal found out for the penalty conceded vs Sunderland. Off the top of my head there were also examples of this against Southampton and PSG, but to lesser extents. Considering the usual confidence he has with the ball this is an odd quirk to his game that will continue to cause problems.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Marking Runners</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Twice already this season Mustafi has failed to track a run appropriately resulting in unnecessary goals against. The most notable was against PSG, but also the recent 3-2 win vs Ludogrets. These are just the two resulting in goals, which for only 11 games isn't a good start. It's not his height that's the problem or even his starting position, it's how he adapts as the winger moves. Fundamentally this comes from poor awareness. The German is prone to ball-watching, meaning the attacker gets a free run on him. This is a big problem and was a consistent issue for Valencia in their terrible 2015/16 season.

        <p class="heading1">The Ugly</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Very little and therein lies the problem.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Unlike a John Stones or Gary Cahill, who may under hit a back pass or get dispossessed on the edge of their box, Mustafi's errors are far less obvious. He's comfortable on the ball and gets involved a lot defensively. At the end of each season stats will go around about how many tackles and interceptions he's made. Unfortunately, defending isn't about how much you do, it's about getting what you attempt right.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Mustafi has four full seasons under his belt now. Each year his club has an inferior win percentage and goal difference per game when he's been on the pitch. I understand that a lot of people don't like this information due to a lack of context with opposition/teammates/tactics, and that's fair. I agree to an extent. But what I will say is on this occasion it goes directly in line with what I see while watching Mustafi.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Arsenal are on a good run now and, like fans of all clubs, will mean everything is great and any negative opinion is wrong. Therefore I don't expect much of a response right now. Enjoy the wins, I certainly am. My point here is that Mustafi's errors will start to cost more than just chances or consolation goals soon. When that happens just remember it isn't bad form or the defenders around him, it's a fundamental problem with his game that has been ignored for far too long.</p>
