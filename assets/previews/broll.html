		<p class="paragraph">Bets are decided based on my probability vs. the betting market’s to find where they might be wrong or too heavy on the favourite. My probability is mainly from JPScore ratings, though home advantage, form, pace in attack and offensive/defensive balance are considered. They are NOT based on the most likely outcome, therefore using the stake provided (or some multiple of it) to bet on singles is important in getting the best long term return. Bets will be posted about 30 minutes before kick-off with updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/intacttactic" target="_blank">@IntactTactic.</a></p>
