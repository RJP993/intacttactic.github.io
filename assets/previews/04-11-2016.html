            <p class="paragraph">As a long serving (and seemingly the only) member of the "Mustafi for £20 mil is crazy" club, I've decided to put my argument across now that Arsenal are on the back of an 11-game unbeaten run with the German international. Primarily because the fee eventually increased to a bizarre £35 mil, way above the initial cost I laughed off, but also because the universal praise seems to be down to results rather than performances.</p>
