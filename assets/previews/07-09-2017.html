			<p class="paragraph">Positions in football generally have an agreed ‘this is what to look for’ rule and, as such, public opinion doesn’t really deviate too far from a player’s actual ability. This isn’t the case with central defenders though and it’s the only outfield role like it. Positional decisions only seem to be criticised if it leads to a goal, centre back reputations are largely determined by their team’s defensive record, and the need and extent of playing out from the back is still a debated topic. This post will be looking at defending on the front foot only.</p>
