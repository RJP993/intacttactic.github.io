			<p class="paragraph">While there’s more of an appreciation of playing out from the back than ever before, debates do still pop up a few times each season. In general I think this is due to a misunderstanding of what good playing out actually is, though the fact that it’s not obvious how much impact it’s having on results probably doesn’t help either. The aim of this post is to provide my theory on play progression and to explain why I believe it to be a necessity for top level centre backs in the modern game.</p>
