		<p class="paragraph">Bets are decided based on my probability vs. the betting market’s to find where they might be wrong or too heavy on the favourite. My probability is mainly from JPScore ratings, though home advantage, form, pace in attack and offensive/defensive balance are considered.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Bets are NOT based on the most likely outcome, therefore using the stake provided (or some multiple of it) to bet on singles is important in getting the best long term return.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">The first season’s betting will be for the Premier League and Bundesliga as they are the two leagues I have covered in detail and tested bets for over the past year. Bets will be posted about 30 minutes before kick-off. Updates will be posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/intacttactic" target="_blank">@IntactTactic.</a></p>
