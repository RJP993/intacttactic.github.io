			<p class="paragraph">In general I think scouting takes at least 10 properly analysed matches before an overall opinion on a player’s ability, traits, weaknesses, and most importantly - consistency, are accurate. I didn’t need that with Seri. His dominance in matches and confidence in his style are instantly noticeable; making the fact it’s taken him until the age of 26 to get recognition by top clubs quite strange.</p>
