<p class="heading2">Everton's Dysfunctional Midfield</p>
<p class="paragraph">While maybe harsh to single out one player in a very open midfield, Idrissa Gueye did stand out as the main liability of the four despite usually being a decent performer. Pedro’s a very intelligent player (which you can read more about <a href="intacttactic.co.uk/?d=16-08-2017#c" target="_blank">here</a>), so being his marker was always going to prove tricky. Whether he was caught ball-watching, pressing instead of sitting or just getting beaten by the movement, Gueye was completely outdone today. Chelsea, namely Fabregas, took advantage of his casual positioning all half by playing early penetrative passes between Everton’s lines.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Tom Davies did a better job of sticking tight and preventing these passes. Gueye struggled with Willian’s runs too whenever Chelsea’s wide men swapped sides, suggesting this element of the tactical setup was an individual performance problem more than anything.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Everton’s shape definitely didn’t help though, generally allowing a 4-v-2 where Rooney and Sigurdsson tracked Chelsea’s wingbacks in the first phase of their build-up. This seemed like a tactical choice as Everton’s attackers remained consistent in their initial pressing positions throughout the half. All this meant for Chelsea is that they could easily play out centrally and then have a piggy in the middle situation with Gueye and Davies.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Generally if you’re blocking the wide options in the early phases, it’s because you’re setting up on the front foot with a high-line and a central pressing trap. This wasn’t the case here at all and Chelsea punished it with intelligent positioning and quick link-up play.</p>
<p class="heading2">Play Progression</p>
<p class="paragraph">The pattern of the match was clear from the off; Chelsea were on the front foot and fast in their passing, Everton were sluggish and reliant on long balls as their outlet. Pickford especially focused on directing his kicks to an advancing Holgate, though Marcos Alonso dominated that aerial battle. Holgate’s offensive intention seemed exclusively to move the ball into the empty space near the corner flag, which unsurprisingly, didn’t create a single attack. Strangely, this never stopped being Everton’s primary offensive plan and the only time possession was retained was on the odd occasion Rooney competed for the header.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Chelsea’s long ball game was significantly less important to them, yet made more of an impact. Morata vs Ashley Williams was a mismatch and his hold-up play provided an outlet for the fullbacks on the rare occasion Everton’s press worked.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Everton’s offensive build-up, aside from the long passes, was through Rooney and Sandro’s spatial awareness between the lines. Individually they were very effective, with several attacks formed through this approach, yet the team never really adapted to support it and overall the midfield did a poor job of finding them.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Again, Tom Davies did a better job than Idrissa Gueye, but given the opportunities both settled for safe passes far too often. The defence had a similar problem. Sigurdsson never did enough to lose his marker or create space for the others. Neither wingback provided enough of an offensive option to trouble Chelsea. It was a very tame offensive performance which produced a half time expected goal total of under 0.1.</p>
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">Chelsea were in complete control with most of their players having stand-out performances. Fabregas played penetrative passes for fun, Marcos Alonso and Azpilicueta continually progressed play from deep and the three attackers had complete performances. Nobody had a bad game and collectively Chelsea’s defensive structure was flawless – credit to Conte for not panicking after the Burnley game.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Wayne Rooney continued his impressive start to his Everton return. Playing behind the attack with a more disciplined positional role, which prevents him from dropping into midfield, suits his ability to find space. It’s still early days but he looks better than at any other point in the last few years, possibly without the expectations that come with being a Man United starter. Michael Keane was typically solid too.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Holgate was poor once again and looks out of his depth. Jagielka’s becoming a problem, his positioning was constantly off and too many times he was beaten by a simple one-two or basic movement. Sigurdsson looked shoehorned in and created a pace problem in attack.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Chelsea have now recovered from the disastrous loss to Burnley on the opening day. Beating Tottenham away redeemed some pride, while today’s professional dismantling of a tired looking Everton side all but confirmed that their consistency is back. It would be unfair to blame Everton’s performance solely on Europa League tiredness. Maybe it played a part, they did miss Schneiderlin and Klaassen in midfield, but Everton were a shambles tactically and never managed to match Chelsea’s quality.</p>
