<p class="heading2">Play Progression Theory</p>
<p class="paragraph">Play progression is essentially the process of advancing closer to the opposition’s goal.</p>
<p class="paragraph">On a most basic level, the main objective in a football match is to score more goals than your opponent. The closer you are to goal, the easier it is to score and therefore being better at progressing play than your opponent should give you a greater chance of winning. It’s a very simple idea but there are a lot of factors that impact how effective it is. This post will cover the aspects that I believe are most important to playing out from the back.</p>
<p class="heading2">Good and Bad Ball Playing</p>
<p class="paragraph">A common criticism of playing out from the back stems from the misconception that a good example of it involves completing a lot of passes around defence. Below is an image illustrating what I believe to be, in general, the most effective (green) and least effective (red) areas for a centre back to pass. Typically a penetrative pass into a green area is the beginning of a counter attack-type situation, as the opposing team has largely been taken out of the game. A pass into a red area on the other hand is generally either giving responsibility to a teammate and backing down from the play yourself, or creating a situation that is likely to lose possession.</p>

<p class="paragraph">My belief with build-up play is that, when it's done effectively, the potential reward outweighs the risk due to the situation that it creates.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Being equipped with two central defenders capable of confidently passing through the lines creates a tactical question for the opposition. Either they have to stop the supply by closing the centre backs down, which frees up more space for midfielders, or they take a risk by dropping deeper and relying on their marking and interceptions to cut out the centre back’s options. Regardless of their choice you are given an edge and will likely be in control. Without a ball playing central defender however, the fear that they will pick out a forward player is no longer apparent, allowing the side without the ball to dictate how you play. This will often create a situation where the team on the ball waste time passing around their defence.</p>

<p class="heading2">Numerical Advantage in Midfield</p>
<p class="paragraph">Having ball playing central defenders creates a numerical advantage in midfield and teams will often try to unsettle this by pressing more than they otherwise would. This is to prevent the centre backs from completing penetrative passes and overall I’d say it’s a better approach than standing off and hoping to block all of their passing lanes. If this more passive approach is taken though, the ball playing centre back will likely just keep moving forward until someone is drawn out. There is a limit to how far forward the centre back should run with the ball - this will be discussed later.</p>

</div>
<p class="paragraph">On the other hand, if you have two central defenders who cannot pass effectively, a supporting midfielder will generally have to drop deeper than usual and do the passing for them. It’s not a major problem but this does mean the opposition can remain in shape and have an extra man in midfield blocking dangerous passes. The speed of the build-up play matters and the longer it takes, the more time the defending side has to organise. This numerical disadvantage means teams can quite easily set up tactically to account for non-ball playing defenders by marking their easy options and forcing them into the ambitious passes that they aren't confident in completing.</p>

<p class="heading2">Running into Midfield</p>
<p class="paragraph">Central defenders moving into midfield is seen as very modern and helping to bring the ball out in such a way is assumed to improve performance. I’m not so sure.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Moving towards the midfield before releasing the ball to a better option (see 2nd animation, slides 6-10) is useful, though any further usually gets messy. Very few central defenders have the skill-set to play in midfield, therefore when they are faced with midfield's smaller spaces and reduced room for error, things start to go wrong. Too often it ends with:<br/>
- The opposition being given a counter attack against a side that now only has one centre back.<br/>
- An over-hit hopeful pass to a teammate who isn't in the position to receive it.<br/>
- The centre back desperately lunging after their loose touch.</p>

<p class="paragraph">A centre back having to dribble or attempt a take-on in midfield is almost always a sign that something has gone wrong, yet it’s universally praised when the take-on is successful. John Stones is the perfect example of this. He's actually quite good as centre backs go at dribbling, yet he has consistently given away cheap goals from attempting take-ons and running into midfield. Playing this way is almost never beneficial and, unsurprisingly, seems to have become far more limited under Guardiola. David Luiz has also reduced how often he attempts this and has improved since doing so. I don't think this is a coincidence.</p>
<p class="heading2">Risk vs. Reward</p>
<p class="paragraph">The other point of view worth addressing is that going long is the safer option. For clarity’s sake, a long pass here is a direct ball that is intended to pick out a teammate, whereas a long ball is more aimless and just to clear the ball away.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Compared to a forward pass being intercepted in the progressing team’s own half, a long ball is less likely to result in a goal conceded. However, over many matches this logic that a long ball is safer seems short-sighted. Even if you ignore clearances and long balls, which are far more wasteful and normally more common in central defenders who do not play out of defence, long passes in the Premier League are only completed at a rate of about 50%. Assuming defences only recover half of the 2nd balls, it still means half of your attacks end up being your opponent’s attacks.</p>
<p class="paragraph">So, while an intercepted pass might be a more obvious individual error, I find it hard to believe that continually ending your own attacks at the first phase of build-up isn't a much bigger problem over time.</p>
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">The most common view on centre backs still seems to be that if they can pass it’s a bonus and there are definitely situations where this is the case. For teams without the technical capability to attack through the midfield, setting up to play direct football makes sense and for this a ball playing centre back may only be a bonus. At just about every top team, and an increasing amount of mid-table or bottom-half sides though, ball playing centre backs should be more valued because they vastly improve performance and are not difficult to sign.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In terms of risk vs. reward, I would argue that this is only a debate because the general view on ball playing is slightly flawed. Teams often sign lightweight defenders and then blame their ball playing when the real problem was their defensive ability and they weren't good enough to be signed in the first place. When defending and ball playing is balanced correctly there is a significantly higher reward involved and the risk is no worse than the alternative of going long.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I strongly believe a central defender can’t be a great player in the modern game without the ability to build play from the back.</p>
