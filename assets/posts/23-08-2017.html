<p class="heading2">Dribbling</p>
<p class="paragraph">Oxlade-Chamberlain is rapid, has accurate feet and great agility. Since 2013/14 he has averaged 6.5 dribbles per 90 minutes with 68% being successful. If dribbling was about just beating your man, then Oxlade-Chamberlain would probably be within the top 3 in the Premier League. Unfortunately, it’s not though. Deciding when to attempt a take-on, knowing where you’re going and selecting the appropriate time to stop are all important factors - it’s what separates the Bolasie’s from the Mane’s.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Despite good ball control, Chamberlain is never really in control of his dribbles. The defender has all the power as they know that if they show him away from goal, or to the corner flag, then that’s where he’ll end up. I can’t stress enough how often this happens. Just about every memory I have of watching Oxlade-Chamberlain is of him dribbling past a player and then chasing his heavy touch towards the corner flag, before attempting a lunged cross. It’s just not an effective way of attacking and generally it gives away possession.</p>
<p class="heading2">Movement</p>
<p class="paragraph">This ineffective on-ball action is matched by his off-ball movement. He’ll drop deep to support the player with the ball in the first phase of build-up, but not in a way that’s particularly helpful in progressing play. In fact, he often ends up in the way as his passing ability and decisions aren’t as good as his teammates’. By dropping so deep the player in possession has one less attacker to pick out.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Similarly, in the final third Chamberlain is quite static. Generally he positions himself out wide without looking to make diagonal runs behind the opposition's defence. Unless the ball is specifically moved to the wing allowing him to attempt a cross, he’s quite irrelevant.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This is represented in his contribution to Arsenal’s offence. Obviously goals and assists aren’t everything, and I’m significantly less interested in this aspect of a player’s game than most people, but comparing his numbers to Arsenal’s other wide options shows that Chamberlain doesn’t do enough. Especially when you consider how often he losses possession.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	Premier League and Champions League minutes per goal or assist 2013-17:<br/>
	Alexis Sanchez 152.5 (7015 mins)<br/>
	Theo Walcott 157.4 (3779 mins)<br/>
	Danny Welbeck 257.5 (1030 mins)<br/>
	Alex Iwobi 258.7 (1552 mins)<br/>
	Alex Ox-Chamberlain 291.1 (3493 mins)
</p>
<p class="paragraph">These numbers are from matches in which the players started on the wing (no sub apps) and all goals and assists are from open play.</p>
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">Having watched just about every minute of football Oxlade-Chamberlain has played throughout his career, I’m struggling to understand why Arsenal haven’t laughed off his £150,000 a week wage demands.</p>
<p class="paragraph">His career has had more month-long injuries than league goals, with his goal tally having never ended higher than 2 in a season. There has been a ridiculous amount of frustrating performances, wasted opportunities and dribbles without a plan. More than anything, he’s taking up space that a better player could be playing in. His career turnaround is a myth and the only reason his best position is still discussed is because he doesn’t impact games as much as he should in the final 3rd as a winger. It’s still his best position and as a squad player or a mid-table starter Chamberlain is an acceptable option. Just not as a £150,000 a week starter for the next five years in a team claiming (does anyone actually believe this?) that they want to win a league title.</p>
<p class="paragraph">With interest higher than ever before, and only one year left on his contract, it’s time that Arsenal gave up on Oxlade-Chamberlain before they’re stuck with yet another squad player on too high a wage to attract a buyer.</p>
