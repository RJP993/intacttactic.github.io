        <p class="heading2">Palermo (Jan 2004 - June 2005)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In 2002 Palermo were taken over by Italian businessman, Zamparini, with the intention of taking them back to Serie A. Palermo finished the 2002/03 Serie B season 6th and were found there again mid-way through the 2003/04 season. It was disappointing first time round, resulting in sackings, and the second time was no different. Silvio Baldini was let go with Palermo's new owners wanting a tactically astute manager with experience in Italian football to replace him. Guidolin was picked up in January 2004 and took them up 5 places in 5 months to win the league.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The 2004/05 season was Palermo's first season in the top flight for 31. Despite being predicted to finish just above the relegation places, Guidolin guided the side to an incredible 6th place finish, qualifying them for the UEFA Cup – this was the first European qualification in the club's history. Palermo reached the last 16 of the Copa Italia before being knocked out to a very strong AC Milan side including Inzaghi, Maldini, Seedorf and Shevchenko. After arguably the best season in the club's history, Guidolin had several offers and decided to try managing abroad.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Monaco (2005-06)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Guidolin was set to join Genoa in 2005, but after a surprise punishment of relegated to the 3rd tier for match fixing, he agreed to join AS Monaco. Monaco were declining; finishing 4 points off top in 2003/04, then 16 points off top in 2004/05, and continued this trend under Guidolin - finishing 32 points off top and in 10th place. This was his only season at the club. Monaco finished between 28 and 36 points off the top spot for the next 5 years and eventually got relegated. Although the fans and board expected more in the 2005/06 season, in retrospect the club probably had deeper problems than the manager.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Palermo (2006-08)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Guidolin's return saw Palermo finish 6 points better off from the previous season and in 5th place. Despite this, Guidolin was again sacked (5 games before the end of the season). The caretaker won 1 and lost 2 before Guidolin's sacking was revoked for the final 2 games. He went on to win both matches to secure European football again. The initial sacking was due to frustration at Palermo's results in the later stages of the season. They spent most of the year in 3rd but began moving down the table as the weeks progressed. Despite everything this was still Palermo highest point total in a season until Walter Sabatini came in as director of football in 2008 and did what he always does – significantly improve his club's stature. Still finishing 5th, Sabatini mixed with Zenga, and then Delio Rossi, finished 7 points higher than Guidolin's Palermo.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">After turning down QPR in 2007, Guidolin was re-hired by Palermo after they had only 4 wins from 13 games. Arguments board for comments such as "it's like playing in hell" saw the owners again release the manager from his contract. Guidolin's reign lasted 17 games and ended with 18 points and many burnt bridges.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Parma (2008-10)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Guidolin joined Parma after their relegation in 2007/08. After a rough spell at Palermo he was looking for a new challenge - considering his experience gaining Serie B promotion, Parma was a good fit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In 2008/09 he guided them to promotion with a 2nd place finish. Parma had a well balanced team and ended up going the season without a home league loss. Returning to Serie A saw his side considered relegation contenders, however after a few months all was forgotten after Parma stormed up the table before settling with an impressive 8th place finish. As a result of the unexpectedly high position he was offered the Udinese job, which he took. Parma finished 12th the season after he left.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Udinese (2010-14)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Udinese had just finished a poor season 2009/10 season, finishing 15th and in need of change. The summer window was originally seen as a disappointment for Udinese with many players being sold, however Armero and Benatia being brought in eventually proved quality business from the club. Udinese had 1 point after 5 games, though the nervous start proved irrelevant as the club hit form soon after, finishing 4th place with the club's highest ever point total. The Champions League qualification game the following season was against Arsenal where, despite playing very well, were eliminated by Arsenal over two tight legs. This involved an aggregate defeat of only 1 goal, plus Szczesny made a wonderful penalty save against Di Natale's late on in the second leg.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Udinese again improved in the following season, finishing 3rd, despite selling key players Alexis Sanchez and Gokhan Inler. This is their highest finish in the club's 118 year history. 2012/13 saw the expected decline from Udinese, from 3rd to 5th. The club had just let a lot of key players leave for a 3rd year running; Asamoah, Isla, Handanovic and German Denis were all sold. All things considered 5th was an achievement.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">The transfer window for the 2013/14 season was disappointing once again as the already light squad became even smaller - Cuadrado, Benatia, Candreva and Armero were all sold. The season went worse than anticipated with Udinese finishing 13th which saw the end of Guidolin's reign as head coach. Guidolin has stated he needs a break from management, but it's likely at 59 he could have another 5-10 years of management if he wants them.</p>

        <p class="heading1">Summary</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Francesco Guidolin has a history of improving teams in varying divisions, financial positions and with different expectations. He's tactically very aware and works hard in his own time to ensure his sides are as well prepared as physically possible. Generally his transfers have been good despite small budgets and big sales; though it's hard to tell how much say he has in them. Italian teams generally have directors of football or higher management deciding the moves. I have some doubts over Guidolin's ability to work abroad due to his lack of experience in this area. It's hard to see why he's been overlooked by every top job in Italy over the last decade, but if he ever does get given a chance I fully expect him to succeed.</p>
