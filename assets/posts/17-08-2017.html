<p class="heading2">Calculating the Table</p>
<p class="paragraph">Each club has been provided a rating for the season based on their: JPScore first team quality, JPScore squad depth, average age, manager influence, long term injuries and European competition interruption. The exception to this are newly promoted teams due to a lack of scouting. Instead, their predictions are signficiantly rougher and are decided on historic trends of promoted teams and only changed when notable signings are made. Every fixture has been simulated using the JPScore betting probabilities to find their expected points in each match.</p>
<p class="heading2">Method</p>
<p class="paragraph">Using data and ideas from <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonGleave?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@SimonGleave’s</a> <a href="https://scoreboardjournalism.wordpress.com/2014/09/11/predicting-the-premier-league/" target="_blank">Predicting the Premier League</a> I was able to create a method of analysing the performance of a predicted league table. All data was based on a previous season and obviously things change season-to-season but as a rough benchmark I think this works.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">
	The method:<br/>
	1) Find the absolute difference in predicted points and actual points<br/>
	2) Same again for predicted position and actual position<br/>
	3) Find the standard deviation of both numbers<br/>
	4) Add them together

<p class="paragraph">@SimonGleave’s post was for the 2014/15 season and had 54 entries; 27 of which were statistical model predictions, 18 from the media and 9 fans. The overall average prediction score was 7.4 (the lower the better), with models averaging a 6.81. First place scored 5.67 and last scored 10.2. Realistically achieving a place in the top 22% would be a good return – for 2014/15 this was anything under 6.5. This is my target for 2017/18 I will evaluated this in a post at the end of the season.</p>
<p class="heading1">Transfers and Important Notes</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">Transfers as of 16/08/2017. At the end of the transfer window, a section will be added to the bottom of this post to discuss the new transfers.</p>
<p class="heading2">Man City</p>
<p class="paragraph">Man City’s transfer window has been incredibly expensive, yet overall pretty mediocre. Kyle Walker (6.75) is JPScore’s second highest rated mover and provides the exact traits that Man City lacked in 2016/17. Benjamin Mendy has the highest peak of the new young signings and has the necessary offensive output for a Guardiola player. Whether he’s ready defensively and in possession I’m not so sure. Danilo is around the same ability but has the exact opposite issues. I expect Bernardo Silva to disappoint and that has been written about in detail <a href="www.intacttactic.co.uk/?d=12-08-2017-2#c" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">It’s likely that Man City will sell several players that JPScore rates highly, despite current expectations saying they’ll be the runaway Premier League winners. Nasri (6.45), Mangala (6.25) and Bony (6.15) are all expected to leave and, assuming they’re not replaced, will reduce their current predicted points from 79.3 to 70.1. It’s a huge and unnecessary downgrade which will leave Guardiola short of high quality squad options.</p>

</div>
<p class="heading2">Chelsea</p>
<p class="paragraph">I’m not quite sure why so much has changed at Chelsea over the summer, or what has caused the atmosphere to sour. Antonio Conte appears frustrated, with many fans predicting he’ll leave within a year. Diego Costa is on holiday pushing for a move and Nemanja Matic was unnecessarily sold to Man United. Matic’s replacement, Tiemoue Bakayoko, has a JPScore of 4.7 which is some way below Chelsea’s average. Antonio Rudiger is similar but at a slightly higher level.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The one positive transfer is Alvaro Morata (6.85) who is JPScore’s highest rated signing for a Premier League team so far. If Diego Costa does leave then they’ve replaced him perfectly and if he doesn’t, they have unbelievable options in attack. Andreas Christensen is back from loan and ready to contribute. He’s rated as potentially elite with an expected peaked of 7.7 - currently within the top 10 under-21 players in the world.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Chelsea still need to improve their squad depth considering the amount of players they have let go. Champions League football forces squad rotation and, as seen in the opening fixture, Chelsea haven’t got that right now. Overall the situation isn’t as bad as it’s being made out to be, it was just very preventable.</p>
<p class="heading2">Arsenal</p>
<p class="paragraph">Alexandre Lacazette is somewhat of a mystery to me. He has the aura of a world class striker, and yet I’ve never really been wowed. It’s possible that his teammates held him back at Lyon, it’s also possible he’s just not as good as he looks he should be. Regardless, he’s a goalscorer and if there’s one thing Arsenal do well, it’s giving chances to their number 9.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Arsenal’s only other signing so far, Sead Kolasinac, has impressed fans early on and marginally improves the JPScore best team. A solid addition, especially as a free transfer, though mistakes will occasionally pop up with his incredibly aggressive style.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Overall, the trasnfer window has been more positive than negative but still not enough to push for a title. Players of quality are lacking and with two weeks of the transfer window remaining and no real rumours, it’s unlikely this will change. Considering Arsenal’s injury history, Santi Cazorla stuck in limbo and JPScore favourite, Theo Walcott, usually watching from the bench, it’s unlikely Arsenal will overachieve their predicted league position.</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">Note: Arsenal were discussed in detail <a href="www.intacttactic.co.uk/?d=11-08-2017-2#c" target="_blank">here</a> before their first game, but there are two changes from that post that need to be mentioned. Firstly, Cazorla is now included for continuity’s sake even though I don’t expect to see him play much in 2017/18. Only players expected to be out injured for over 4 months are now excluded from the team ratings. In addition, a bug was found when calculating Arsenal’s rating. These two factors have seen their expected points rise from 71 to 73.3 ahead of the season.</p>
<p class="heading2">Liverpool</p>
<p class="paragraph">Mohamed Salah (5.9) and Andrew Robertson (4.5) are the only two over-21 additions so far with Lucas Leiva (5.8) and Kevin Stewart (4.7) leaving the club. Nothing really seems to have changed from last season with the goalkeeper and defence still a worry. Alberto Moreno (4.3) has apparently had a miracle revival in pre-season but I highly doubt this opinion will last very long. Mamadou Sakho (6.85) is Liverpool’s 3rd highest rated player and seemingly the obvious solution to Liverpool’s defensive issues; however Jurgen Klopp reportedly has problems with Sakho’s attitude.</p>
<p class="paragraph">If Moreno is Liverpool’s left back for the season and Sakho is sold without being replaced, Liverpool’s predicted points fall from 70.4 to 64.5.</p>
<p class="heading2">Man United</p>
<p class="paragraph">I personally think Man United are better than their JPScore prediction. Paul Pogba (5.85) shows the problem with one-year ratings as his 2016/17 was way off the level he can perform at.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Man United’s predicted points are also held back by their wide attacking options. Marcos Rashford (4.6) is still very young, so despite his 6.25 expected peak, his current influence will fluctuate. Anthony Martial has similar issues to both Pogba and Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young are underwhelming options for a team going for a title, and Juan Mata just isn’t a wide player, despite being used there in the opening fixture.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Man United have had the most consistent and solid transfer window so far with Matic (5.85), Lukaku (6.5) and Lindelof (6) joining the club. If they can get a first team winger there’s no reason this side can’t win the league. I can’t see it happening without that though.</p>
<div class="imageWrapper">

</div>
<p class="heading2">Tottenham</p>
<p class="paragraph">Tottenham’s transfer window has been so irrelevant I genuinely forgot to include them in this list originally. No one has been signed, Kyle Walker has been sold.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Tottenham’s predicted points have taken somewhat of a hit this season due to their home fixtures being played at Wembley.</p>
<p class="heading2">Everton</p>
<p class="paragraph">The most active movers and the most overrated transfer window, Everton aren’t any better than in 2016/17. Lukaku, Gerard Deulofeu and Garth Barry have left with Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Jordan Pickford, Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez coming in. Quantity doesn’t mean quality, especially when it creates a clear problem with pace. Michael Keane (5.8) was a much needed solid central defender, though the other end of the pitch has lost a lot of goals in Lukaku. Is Rooney still capable of scoring consistently? I have my doubts. Sandro Ramirez is only 22 and quite a wasteful shoot-on-sight type of striker. Leighton Baines, Sigurdsson and Rooney are all set-piece takers, and therefore the two missing out will lose some of their previous value. Sigurdsson is especially reliant on this.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I can’t see Everton matching their 2016/17 points tally this season but I also can’t see many teams knocking them off 7th place. There’s very little pace in that side and the Europa League will cause extra squad rotation. Ronald Koeman does have a knack with under-23 players and slow teams though, so these factors will be smaller than under an alternative manager.</p>
<p class="heading2">Leicester</p>
<p class="paragraph">Planning for the future seems to be a clear focus of Leicester’s following their league title in 2015/16. As well as Harry Maguire (24 years old) and Kelechi Iheanacho (20 years old), recent signings have mostly been under the age of 25. Last season Wilfred Ndidi, Nampalys Mendy, Ahmed Musa and Bartosz Kapustka were all brought to the club. With four of their five best players according to JPScore over the age of 30, and the other (Danny Drinkwater) being heavily linked with Chelsea, perhaps setting up their next generation isn’t a bad idea.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Harry Maguire (5.6) was a very important signing given the lack of acceptable central defenders for Leicester in 2016/17. Vicente Iborra adds depth to a problem position last season, however the quality is still some way off replacing Ngolo Kante. Kelechi Iheancho is a talented player and will likely work out very well in the long run. I'm not entirely sure what their target is for the season. Somewhere near Everton and north of 50 points would probably represent a good year.</p>
<div class="imageWrapper">
        <img class="image" src="assets/postImages/17-08-2017/drinkwater.png" />
</div>
<p class="heading2">Southampton</p>
<p class="paragraph">I was impressed by Mario Lemina from his occasional sub appearances at Juventus; he could prove to be a bargain. Jay Rodriguez left the club which isn’t a big deal. Aside from that, and the Virgil Van Dijk rumours, not much has gone on over the summer at Southampton.</p>
<p class="paragraph">With or without Van Dijk they need a central defender. Maya yoshida (4.35) and Jack Stephens (4) proved last season they aren’t up to the task. If Southampton want to get back to pushing for Europa League football this area will need to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="heading2">West Ham</p>
<p class="paragraph">West Ham’s transfer window and overall target has been discussed in detail <a href="intacttactic.co.uk/?d=13-08-2017#c" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">Note: West Ham’s expected points have since fallen from 50 to 47.4 due to the managerial influence on team ratings increasing.</p>
<p class="heading2">Stoke</p>
<p class="paragraph">Stoke’s ability to sign players that JPScore classes as “safe bottom half – to mid-table” is second to none. Darren Fletcher, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, Bruno Martins Indi and Jese Rodriguez all fit that tag, totalling an incredible 15 players in that category. As a result, it’s hard to see anything but a mid-table finish as their outcome for the season, despite Joey Allen, Xherdan Shaqiri and Bojan Krkic pulling the average rating up.</p>
<div class="imageWrapper">
        <img class="image" src="assets/postImages/17-08-2017/allen.png" />
</div>
<p class="heading2">Newcastle</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">Note: I know very little about the newly promoted sides and have therefore avoided discussing expectations. Predictions are made by looking at historic trends based on points and goal difference in the Championship. Small alterations are made depending on signings or returning loans. This applies to Brighton and Huddersfield too.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Newcastle’s expected points are currently inflated by Siem De Jong (6.5) who is one of the league’s better players who always misses a lot of games. Florian Lejeune is an acceptable addition for a bottom half team, even if he does rush out of the defensive line too often. Manquillo struggled last season, how much that changes away from a dire Sunderland team, who knows.</p>
<p class="heading2">West Brom</p>
<p class="paragraph">The signings of Gareth Barry and Jay Rodriguez bolstered a depleted squad, though as quality goes they are still severely lacking. Tony Pulis’ added value and Jonny Evan’s underrated ability are the only two factors keeping West Brom from an almost certain relegation according to JPScore. It’s a boring prediction for the most boring team in the league, but West Brom are expected to do what they always do: get low-40 points and remain in the Premier League.</p> 
<div class="imageWrapper">
        <img class="image" src="assets/postImages/17-08-2017/evans.png" />
</div>
<p class="heading2">Watford</p>
<p class="paragraph">Despite new first team players, Andre Gray and Kiko Femenia, the squad depth rating for Watford is drastically pulling their expected points down. With 15 of their main 26 players being classed as relegation battlers or lower, Watford are always one injury or rotation from a weak performer coming in. This showed drastically at the end of the 2016/17 season when the final few weeks had rotated lineups selected. Six matches were lost in a row with 16 goals conceded and only 3 goals scored.</p>
<p class="paragraph">If Watford can keep their best players fit then there’s no reason they can’t push for 10th. If not, they could be relegated. Considering they have Marco Silva in charge, I suspect they’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="heading2">Bournemouth</p>
<p class="paragraph">Bournemouth’s transfer window has been pretty simple all in all. Nathan Ake’s only 22 but already marginally improves their best starting team. Asmir Begovic is quite an average Premier League goalkeeper and will provide an alternative to Arthur Boruc who could quite possibly be in his last season before retirement. The signing of Jermain Defoe on a three-year deal was stupid. He’s never been my type of striker, the shoot-on-sight approach is so wasteful and all about personal glory, but at least in the past he had some quality too. Last year he was barely able to keep up with play at times, albeit in a terrible Sunderland team.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Not enough seems to have been done overall and I can see Bournemouth falling into the relegation places.</p>
<div class="imageWrapper">
        <img class="image" src="assets/postImages/17-08-2017/defoe.png" />
</div>
<p class="heading2">Brighton</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">See Newcastle for the note about newly promoted teams.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Davy Propper has impressed me from the limited amount of matches I’ve seen him in; he could prove to be an important player for Brighton. I don’t feel confident in commenting on their other signings just yet.</p>
<p class="heading2">Burnley</p>
<p class="paragraph">Sean Dyche’s ultra-defensive style provided enough game-to-game consistency in 2016/17 that he’s a surprise face in the very short “managers that add value” list. As previously mentioned, this list isn’t about managerial ability or any tactical considerations. Rather, it's purely how consistent results were over the course of last season, regardless of their lineup. Despite his boost, Burnley are still predicted relegation battlers with their two most influential players, Andre Gray and Michael Keane, leaving the club. Jack Cork (5.75) is a good signing for Burnley and rates as their new best player.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Judging by performances last year, my gut instinct is that Burnley won't avoid the drop, especially considering the squad is even weaker now. However, after their shock away win to Chelsea on the opening day, JPScore has become more confident than its pre-season table above, now predicting them 15th.</p>
<p class="heading2">Huddersfield</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">See Newcastle for the note about newly promoted teams.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Huddersfield have brought Tom Ince to the Premier League, and while I haven’t seen a huge amount of his matches, what I have seen suggests he at least deserves a chance. Jonas Lossl was terrible in most areas for Mainz in 2016/17. I’m yet to see any of their other signings play.</p>
<p class="heading2">Swansea</p>
<p class="paragraph">Similar to Watford, Swansea’s squad is incredibly mixed. Fernando Llorente ranks as one of the league’s best attackers, Martin Olsson was a solid addition in January, and Roque Mesa (5.3) should bring back some of the old Swansea passing flair. The rest of the squad are either young, Premier League average, or just bad. Very bad in fact. Excluding under-21 players and newly promoted teams, Swansea’s bottom 5 players average a JPScore of 3.9. The lowest aside from from Crystal Palace (3.95) and no other Premier League side comes close to that rating.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Excluding Roque Mesa, Swansea’s transfer window has underwhelmed. Borja Baston was loaned out after never really being given a chance, Jack Cork was sold to a relegation rival, and Sigurdsson has finally completed his far too expensive move to Everton. This frees up funds to improve the squad but they have also lost their 3rd best player. Tammy Abraham has joined on loan with all the hype you expect from a young English striker off the back of a goal scoring streak. I’m not a fan from the limited matches I’ve seen, he seems reluctant to get involved and that will be noticed in the Premier League.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Fortunately for Swansea, they have Fernando Llorente who will probably play just about all of the season and improve their average quite drastically. Whether it’s enough to avoid relegation I’m not quite sure. It does seem that they are still a few first team regulars short of avoiding relegation.</p>
<div class="imageWrapper">
        <img class="image" src="assets/postImages/17-08-2017/llorente.png" />
</div>
<p class="heading2">Crystal Palace</p>
<p class="paragraph">Things look bleak for Crystal Palace. With only one permanent signing so far, Jairo Riedewald (20 years old), and the loans of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (21) and Timothy Fosu-Mensah (19), I can’t see any real improvement to the squad. Steve Mandanda (5) has returned to Marseille, meaning Wayne Hennessey (4.1) is currently first choice. This goalkeeper situation was a problem last season and will continue to be until Hennessey is replaced.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The squad is small, lacks quality and has already dropped 1.5 expected points in the season’s opener at home to Huddersfield. I’m a De Boer sceptic at the best of times and in this situation, with all odds against him, I’ll be very surprised if he keeps Crystal Palace from relegation.</p>
<p class="heading1">End of Transfer Window</p>
<p class="paragraph bold">While I aim not to make a habit of editing posts, I will be writing this section at the end of the transfer window to talk about the remaining transfers and to update the predicted table.</p>
