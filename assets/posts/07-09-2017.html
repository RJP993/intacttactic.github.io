<p class="heading2">Bad Front Foot Defending</p>
<p class="paragraph">The most dangerous final pass in football is a through ball. <a href="https://twitter.com/MC_of_A?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@MC_Of_A</a> found that shots following a through ball are <a href="https://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com/2013/11/16/5111212/shot-matrix-iii-the-incredible-through-ball" target="_blank">between two and three times more likely</a> to result in a goal than a normal shot from the same area of the pitch. Considering the purpose of a through ball is to split a defence, this isn’t too surprising. What is surprising is that the main defensive action that initiates the through ball is commonly praised. Being on the front foot is not exclusively a good thing and often defenders who run out aren’t being proactive, they’re being hot-headed.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Rushing out and failing to win possession shouldn’t be treated as a minor error given the opportunity it allows the opposition - a hole in the defence is a big deal.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This is easier to explain with a visual example.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The point of this animation is to show just how easily this situation can be created and avoided. Obviously this example is specific but it applies to all interception attempts by centre backs, especially those in low blocks – getting it wrong is often costly.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Of the big name central defenders, Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis Papastathopoulos are probably the two worst at judging these plays. On a weekly basis they cause their teams several problems by attempting interceptions and making openings in their defence, thus detracting from their team’s performance. I wrote about Mustafi <a href="intacttactic.co.uk/?d=04-11-2016#c" target="_blank">here</a> and provided several examples of his poor front foot decisions over the course of one of his games. Since writing this his reputation has dropped, however the initial view of his ability being so high is part of the problem. Views of centre backs are reactive and based on a team's week to week results.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Over time these types of defenders are usually found out, it just takes significantly longer than it should. Hot-headedness isn’t exactly subtle so failing to notice this glaring weakness suggests it’s not really being looked at by managers and scouts.</p>
<p class="heading2">Good Front Foot Defending</p>
<p class="paragraph">On the other end of the scale, Mats Hummels, Raul Albiol and Jonny Evans are probably the best examples of reading these plays correctly on a consistent basis. Each manages to prevent attacks before they start by positioning themselves close enough that they’re able to intercept if the opportunity arises, but also remain deep enough that they aren’t neglecting the game behind them. Not only does it make attacks difficult for the opposition, it also allows a counter attacking opportunity to begin if the ball is won.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This understanding of the most urgent threat is the key to providing value on the front foot. Where Mustafi and Sokratis have no filter with what they’ll rush out for, a Hummels or Albiol are far more calculated in their actions. The best example to explain the differences here is David Luiz.</p>
<p class="paragraph">While by no means ever a bad player, Luiz’s early career was heavily criticised (probably overly so) due his hot-headed nature. His timing was usually off and it did result in a fair few goals against. Over time he has matured into one of the best front foot defenders in the game by adapting to situations rather than forcing himself into them.</p>
<p class="paragraph">It’s rare a player is capable of changing their instincts so I’m always sceptical when I hear that a player ‘just has to stop doing X’ or ‘change that part of his game’. The fact David Luiz is the only example I can think of suggests that analysing how a player acts in these situations is important because there’s a good chance it won’t change with coaching or different tactics.</p>
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">Rushing out a lot doesn’t make you a good front foot defender, getting it right does. Looking at number of interception is pointless with central defenders; fundamentally the situation is the most important aspect.</p>
<p class="paragraph">It should be noted that being weak in this area doesn’t necessarily make you a bad player, you just have to be very good elsewhere to balance this. Sergio Ramos, Nicolas Otamendi and Kyriakos Papadopoulos are all some of the best defenders in the world, they’d just be even better if they weren’t as eager to vacate the defence.</p>
