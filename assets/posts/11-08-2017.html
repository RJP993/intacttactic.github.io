<p class="heading1">JPScore</p>
<p class="paragraph">I watch a lot of football (probably too much) and I like to think I’m a pretty good judge of player. At the beginning of the 2016/17 season I decided to start noting down my player ratings for each match for a bit of fun and as a way of remembering what I’d seen. 793 games later and what I’m left with is an opinion-based scouting database.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Obviously it’s still early days and rating players based on a single season is largely form oriented. However, overall I’m very happy with the outcome and look forward to seeing how players’ performances change over the coming years. A rough age curve has been implemented into the ratings, goalkeeper impact was toned back to a level I’m satisfied with, and players aged 16-26 have a predicted ability at 27 years old based on ability and recent performance trends.</p>
<p class="paragraph">More than anything I’m just curious to see how right or wrong my scouting is over time.</p>
<p class="heading1">Website Layout</p>
<p class="paragraph">To hopefully make this site easier to navigate, I have split things up into three main categories...
<p class="heading2">Writeups</p>
<p class="paragraph">Previously my website posts were quite long and reading them back it's mostly unnecessary. That's changing now. I don't think people want to read that much and I lose interest writing it.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Write-ups will mostly consist of tactical overviews of teams that I find interesting. The underrated manager series will continue eventually. Posts analysing the JPScore betting will be provided here too.</p>
<p class="paragraph">There will not be any guest writing on this website.</p>
<p class="heading2">Players</p>
<p class="paragraph">As the main focus of the website is scouting, players have been provided their own category.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">Here I aim to write detailed player reports with strengths, weaknesses and JPScore over time charts. The end goal is to have a long list of analysed players which can be a go-to source for player reports. Requests for JPScore charts can be made on Twitter.</p>
<p class="heading2">Betting</p>
<p class="paragraph">This is also mentioned in the disclaimer at the bottom of the site (which I recommend you read if you are using this section), but let me start by saying that I do not encourage gambling, I accept no responsibility for any losses incurred on anything mentioned on this site and that this is intended as simple fun.
<p class="paragraph">After a few months of scouting I decided to start testing JPScore ratings against betting sites. I’ve always felt there’s value to found in betting based on lineups as (I think I’m right in saying) it’s not a consideration of the bookie, unless a team’s lineup is drastically stronger or weaker than their norm.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Probabilities are found by looking at JPScore ratings to find the average of the starting 11's. Home advantage, pace in attack and drastic form are the only other considerations.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">The stake of each bet is determined by the value found between the JPScore probability and the betting market. If you want to use the JPScore tips my advice would be to bet proportionally based on the stake I provided.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Of the 137 games tested between February and May, 70 games were found to have value vs. the betting market. A total of £540 was staked, returning a profit of £470. Not bad returns for an average stake of £7.71.</p>
