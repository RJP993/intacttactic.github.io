<p class="heading2">Young Players</p>
<p class="paragraph">The 2016/17 season was a struggle for Dortmund, 64 points and a last minute race for 3rd place was not up to their usual standards. Their JPScore squad quality rating (best 15 players) and squad depth rating (best 23) ranked significantly higher than every other team in the league aside from Bayern Munich. Thomas Tuchel took the blame for this underachievement and was removed from the club at the end of the season. This was probably a bit harsh given the club’s performances in his first year and the fact that his planning had a clear long term focus.</p>
<p class="paragraph">JPScore betting did notice a clear trend with Dortmund’s results however, which Tuchel never really adapted to. Team selection had a severe influence on their outcome, yet the same few low-rated players continued to feature. Some of these ratings were low due to age but this doesn’t change the fact they were still dragging the overall quality down. Timing of when and how to use young players is a skill – Dortmund just seemed to pick them on a whim last year. Three teenagers away to Bayern Munich for example, no wonder they were smashed 4-1.</p>
<p class="paragraph">It’s their reliance on the young players that is the problem rather than the fact that they’re selecting them. Julian Weigl played the 4th most minutes in the league last year for Dortmund at the age of 21. He’s a fan favourite and seen as the golden boy for the next generation, though that hype is a mystery to me. He’s good on the eye but actual impact is only passable. Physically he struggles and, while there’s a clear stylistic idea in how he plays, I don’t see his ability ever coming close to the current expectation. Ginter, 22 years old, somehow managed the 2nd highest amount of time played at Dortmund despite very few of those minutes involving him playing well. Christian Pulisic is one of the best teenage prospects in the world with a JPScore expected peak at 7.5 (world class). He’s still only 18 though. Expecting him to consistently contribute enough value to a top club is unrealistic. Dortmund won 46.7% of the 15 league starts with Pulisic compared to 78.9% without him. This stat does lack a lot of context; the point is that young players do almost always hinder performances. Ousmane Dembele fits into a similar category but is a year more developed and currently ranks as the biggest under 23 prospect in the world with an expected JPScore peak of 7.95. JPScore predicts that his current influence on matches is lower than public opinion suggests, but unlike Pulisic, Dembele is not seen as downgrading the lineup’s average. Passlack (18) and Mor (19), were used appropriately last season, completing about 500 minutes each.</p>

<p class="heading2">Rest of the Squad</p>
<p class="paragraph">As previously stated, JPScore’s ratings and public opinion are quite different. Schmelzer ranks as the squad’s best player (JPScore of 7.2) whereas Reus (5.8) is seen as about average for a Dortmund player (5.7). Injuries have heavily affected Reus’ ability and again he’s set to miss a large chunk of the season. Sokratis (5.2) was the 5th most used player last season despite ranking below the Dortmund average. Seen as an unquestioned first team regular for four years now, I’m quite surprised Sokratis’ over-aggressive style and lack of positional sense is still ignored. Gotze (7) and Kagawa (6.55) are two of the highest rated within the squad by JPScore, yet very little attention has been given to either since their returns. Sahin (5.85) is similar. As is squad outcast, Subotic (5.85). Admittedly injuries have played a part in some of these players being neglected. Schurrle (5.9) is also rated higher than what his reputation suggests it should be. Despite greediness and a messy style, Schurrle’s movement between the lines and his awareness to get into goal scoring positions currently brings more value than their other wide options.</p>

<p class="heading2">Transfers</p>
<p class="paragraph">As mentioned, Ginter (4.75 – expected peak 5.1) was not rated very highly. His sale will give more space for better central defenders to play, and with the signing of Toprak (6.5), it’s like the improvement will be noticeable. The sale of Sven Bender (5.55) and Adrian Ramos (5.25) will reduce the squad depth slightly, though both ranked below the Dortmund average anyway. Mahmoud Dahoud (5.35 – expected peak 6.8) is seen as a huge under 23 prospect but may take a year or two to provide genuine value to the squad. Dortmund’s most expensive transfer of the window, the signing of Maximilian Phillip (5.3 – peak 5.95), might actually prove to be their least relevant.</p>
<p class="heading1">Prediction</p>
<p class="paragraph">Dortmund’s best 11 is solid all round with quality sprinkled throughout. If they wanted to push for a title, they could improve their goalkeeper, holding mid and right winger but the current options are fine. The young players are a year more developed now and team selection may improve under the new manager. Overall Dortmund have upgraded on last season as things stand, Toprak especially will help provide the consistency that has been lacking in recent years. Ousmane Dembele is understandably attracting big interest from Barcelona and Aubameyang (6.3) might still move to AC Milan this window. Replacements will be needed if either are sold due to the squad's lack of depth in these areas.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Taking squad quality, squad depth, manager ability, European competitions, squad age and long-term injuries into account, JPScore’s pre-season prediction has Dortmund to finish comfortably 2nd with 73 points.</p>
