<p class="heading2">Balancing Aggression</p>
<p class="paragraph">There’s a trend in modern football to praise centre backs for “getting involved” without looking at how their tendency to rush out of defence affects the team’s solidity. I wrote about it in a piece on Shkodran Mustafi <a href="intacttactic.co.uk/?d=04-11-2016#c" target="_blank">here</a>, but to summarise: it’s not beneficial to the team unless your timing of the interceptions is accurate.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Ben Gibson’s biggest strength is his anticipation of the opposition’s forward pass, as it consistently allows him extra time to prepare his positioning for the forward’s movement. His decision making of when to step in front of his man to win possession, or to drop back a yard and force the attacker to remain with their back to goal was flawless in 2016/17 and contributed noticeably to Middlesbrough’s impressive defensive record. This is basic in principle, yet judging play and executing the correct response at the top level is not easy.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Defending counter attacks individually poses similar questions for central defenders. Diving in too early can be costly as it can cause a red card or a one-on-one, yet standing off for too long allows more options to open up for the attacker and for the last ditch tackle to be risking a penalty. Despite their solid defensive numbers, Middlesbrough’s style was relatively open against possession turnovers last year, meaning this situation occurred on a regular basis. The only reason it wasn’t a noticeable problem was because the defence was really impressive at closing off the opposition’s attackers at the right times. Ben Gibson was especially assured, usually dropping as the deepest defender, looking to sweep up any loose passes or touches.</p>
<p class="heading2">Ball Playing</p>
<p class="paragraph">Line breaking defenders are vital at top level football, they can singlehandedly split the opposition's press and allow their offence to start what is essentially a counter attacking situation. The next best thing is a technical defender capable of moving the ball into midfield without creating unnecessary nervousness at the back while being pressed. Ben Gibson falls somewhere between the two categories. His ability to pick out the striker is apparent, though obviously falls short of a Hummels or Bonucci-level passer.</p>
<p class="paragraph">What is clear is that Ben Gibson is not fazed by pressure, his better games coming against the big teams. Even when faced with a high press and very little teammate support, he found a way to dribble into space and pick out the correct forward pass. Basically, what John Stones is hyped for but very rarely does.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This is an area for England that is always a problem. Defenders, although admittedly not helped by midfield movement, do very little to progress play and instead get stuck passing side to side in the hope that a teammate creates an attack for them.</p>
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">England’s central defence has been a problem for years, yet the same approach of starting the underachieving media favourites still stands. Over the last 18 months Gary Cahill has become the first name on the team sheet and if that doesn’t kill your international hopes then I don’t know what will. Meanwhile, John Stones has solidified his place in the team off the back of his fourth consecutive poor Premier League season.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In contrast, Harry Maguire has only just received his first call-up, and what a coincidence, it happened after transferring to a more popular side in Leicester City. Michael Keane is in a better position, though it took until Burnley were essentially safe from relegation before he was handed his international debut. Fortunately, he’s an Everton player now so his England place is a lot safer.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Ben Gibson hasn’t even been selected for the upcoming friendlies and won’t be involved until he’s back out of the Championship. There’s less than a week left in the transfer window now so it’s unlikely that he’ll get the move he deserves, especially considering it’ll leave his childhood (and uncle’s) club short for the season. It’s a massive shame as it essentially rules him out of consideration for the 2018 World Cup and we don’t have the squad depth to replace a player of his quality.</p>
<p class="paragraph">JPScore ranked Ben Gibson as England’s best central defender in 2016/17 and as the 7th best England player overall.</p>
