<p class="heading2">Play Progression</p>
<p class="paragraph">There arent many central midfielders who are not only willing to collect the ball in any deep positions, but also intelligent enough to find the space to create the next forward pass. Seri not only excels at this, but is also technically capable of beating the opposition's press with a dribble or a penetrative pass. These traits are held almost exclusively by starting central midfielders of the top few clubs in Europe, yet Seri manages it with an effortless swagger. Unsurprisingly this has impressed many who have checked out highlights and compilations on YouTube, though unlike most flashy players, Seri actually provides value to his team and improves the overall team performance.</p>
<p class="heading2">Overall Contribution</p>
<p class="paragraph">Seri is not a player that neglects the defensive side of the game. His acceleration can frustrate the opposition's midfielders as he’s quick to close players down or win 50/50’s, plus if they beat him he has the pace to recover. That being said, his skillset is definitely more suited to being on the ball. His speed and dribbling ability is almost unparalleled among central midfielders and his high-tempo passing sets the bar for the rest of the team.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Seri isn’t scared of taking responsibility in matches. In 2016/17 Seri completed more passes per 90 minutes than any other Nice player with 83.4, the 3rd highest in the league behind Verratti and Thiago Motta. These passes are often forward and ambitious – last season providing 9 assists (ranking 2nd highest in the league) and completing the 5th most key passes per 90 (over 1,000 minutes). In addition, Seri scored 7 goals, though it’s likely this contribution is unsustainable in the long term given the quality of these chances. Either way, contributing to so many phases of play in such an influential way is rare.</p>
<p class="heading2">Overconfidence</p>
<p class="paragraph">The level of confidence Seri has in his own ability has seen him lose possession in dangerous areas on occasion. Obviously this is a consequence of the high-risk high-reward style of play and over a season this is definitely far more beneficial than playing safe. However, improving his decisions in these situations is still an area of his game that could be developed as good chances were given away at times from lapses in concentration.</p> 
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">According to JPScore, Nice’s excellent 2016/17 campaign was heavily influenced by 4 players – Seri (7.2), Dante (6.8), Belhanda (6.55) and Dalbert (6.15). Two of these have now left, and while there are still some solid Ligue 1 players in their squad, the next best player is only rated 5.35. With or without Seri it’s hard to see Nice pushing on from last season. They have lost their opening two games, face a busier schedule due to the European matches, and have an inferior squad compared to last year. He’s taken Nice as far as they can go and unsurprisingly the biggest teams, including Barcelona, Arsenal and Liverpool, have begun circling. If the rumours of a £36m buyout clause are true it’s hard to see him still being a Nice player on September 1st.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Seri is quite possibly the best player that the average football fan has yet to see play. JPScore ranks him as one of the top 50 players in the world and as one of the top 10 central midfielders.</p>
