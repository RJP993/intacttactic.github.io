<p class="heading2">Style Over Substance</p>
<p class="paragraph">Bernardo Silva is a silky player. His agility and creativity with skills make him difficult to tackle and as a fan this is usually entertaining. I don't find this the case with Silva though. It's frustrating. For all the possession and attempted take-ons, so little is productive and he gives possession away too often for the amount of chances created. His physicality prevents powerful runs and therefore a certain level of finesse is required to progress play and create chances. It's never really the case here though, at least not enough for the level he's stepping up to. With both Monaco and Portugal it seems the other attackers take more responsibility than him in the final third, Man City have too many good forward players to allow that to happen.</p>
<p class="heading2">Final Third Play</p>
<p class="paragraph">As movement goes Bernardo Silva just isn’t particularly special. Generally his forward runs are with the intent of cutting a cross back from the byline. Man City are heavily focused on byline crosses and they can be very effective, but with Bernardo Silva they’re often tame. His main type of movement outside the box is also to create a byline cross, this time for a teammate. Again, not a bad thing in itself, it’s just not an overly productive method of attacking if you’re ignoring the attackers in better positions - which he sometimes does.</p>
<p class="heading2">Play Progression</p>
<p class="paragraph">Responsibility plays a big part in the role of a wide player. While there are many different types of winger, being a forward option, an outlet, and a threat to the opposition's defensive line are all expected in some way. Bernardo Silva only really covers the outlet side to a level expected of a top-4 player. While maybe not bursting past defenders or carrying the team up the pitch, he does dribble past people effectively to protect possession.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Unfortunately he does lack effective positioning through the lines as a top club’s outlet. There is some ball watching here and just a general lack of intelligence to be a top player. Better offensive players are always seeking space to allow the player in possession to take oppositions out the game with one forward pass. Bernardo Silva’s awareness of space is quite average for a Premier League attacker and that will likely show under a manager who priorities it, like Guardiola.</p>
<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">The frustration with Bernardo Silva is that his impact on matches is lower than his ability suggests it should be. He’s technically excellent and a very talented dribbler. He’s also tame in front of goal and relies on teammates too often. Age could be playing a part here and either way he’s not a bad player. But given the hype, the fee, and the expectation as a youth prospect I just don’t think he’s meeting the heights that public opinion suggests he is. With Man City’s focus on byline cutbacks I can see why they’ve signed Bernard Silva, I’m just sceptical as to whether he’ll work out as well as he’s expected to.</p>
