<p class="heading1">Napoli</p>
<p class="paragraph">Napoli's two seasons under Maurizio Sarri have seen them reach 82 points (11 pts off Juventus) and 86 points (5 off Juve). Last season they finished with the best goal difference despite losing Gonzalo Higuain and looked the most cohesive side. Results and performances have remained consistent over the two years and the squad doesn't face many ageing or injury concerns.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
Squad depth has been an issue for a while. Seriously inferior backups or under-22’s have been relied on and as a result points are often dropped when the lineup is rotated. With a few solid squad additions so far, and their young players more experienced, squad depth is less of a worry leading into the new season. Currently Napoli’s depth ranks 3rd after Juventus and Roma according to JPScore (best 23 players), however the gap isn’t too big.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">Interestingly, Napoli lead the JPScore squad quality race (best 15 players) ahead of the new season. It's a strong best eleven without many weak or even average points. Callejon probably brings the least of the outfielders but is by no means a liability. Reina is the weakest performer overall, possibly due to age, but perfectly suits Sarri's style. JPScore currently ranks Hamsik and Raul Albiol as world class which puts Napoli one ahead of Juventus, Roma and AC Milan for world class players. In summary, while it's close, Napoli are currently in the best position heading into the season.</p>

<p class="heading1">Rivals</p>
<p class="heading2">Juventus</p>
<p class="paragraph">Juve's consistency over the past 6 years may finally be rocked by the sale of Bonucci, one of their two world class players in 2016/17 according to JPScore. Their transfer window as a whole has been unusually questionable. Douglas Costa is a good addition and Szczesny provides extra depth, though I have my doubts he'll be trusted as Buffon's long term successor. Bernardeschi at £36m and De Sciglio for £11m seem wildly misjudged. Both are far from the quality required for the Serie A favourite. Bernardeschi's talent and physique is severly hindered by his game intelligence – poor decisions and greediness run through his game and I don’t see this changing. Dani Alves leaving was a surprise to me and his offensive output will be missed.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">Overall Juventus look to have dropped a level and that's before you consider the age of the squad - Buffon and Barzagli in particular. They could still win the title without a big signing but I find it hard to believe it'll be comfortable.</p>

<p class="heading2">Roma</p>
<p class="paragraph">Roma had a very strong 2016/17 but have since lost 3 of their 10 most regular players. Destabilising a winning side is almost never a good thing and although I think Salah and Rudiger are a bit overrated, they did provide stylistic traits that Roma may now lack. De Rossi, another of the 10 regulars, is 34 years old and performances are quite clearly declining. It's likely his place will be lost to Gonalons which JPScore sees as a clear upgrade. Another clear upgrade is the signing of Hector Moreno which should complete a very strong spine.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">Overall the Roma side seems better on paper, aside from losing Salah, though so much change brings many question marks. Totti's retired, Spalletti quit, and many transfers occurred. I can't see it not affecting the consistency Roma maintained throughout 16/17.</p>

<p class="heading2">AC Milan</p>
<p class="paragraph">The only other side with realistic hopes for a title is AC Milan. £170m has been spent (and spent well), rumours of one more big addition continue to spread, and as of yet no player of note has been sold. Bonucci is the JPScore highest rated transfer of the window so far with Biglia not too far behind. Most of the other transfers are solid additions or players with big potential. Andre Silva is especially impressive. Whether or not this is enough to close a 28 point gap I'm not so sure.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Similar to Roma, changing a lot can take time to run smoothly. Unlike their rivals, Milan's squad depth concerns are reduced by their lack of European football next season. The real worry is team cohesion. You aren't given much room for error in a title race so Milan will need to get things together quickly. I'm not convinced they will.</p>
