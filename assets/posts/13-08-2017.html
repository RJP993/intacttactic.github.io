<p class="heading1">Expectations</p>
<p class="paragraph">While maybe not what the fans want to hear, West Ham’s 62 points in 2015/16 was an outlier. They’ve broken the 50 point mark in a Premier League season just once in 8 years, and did so by outperforming their <a href="https://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com/2014/2/12/5404348/english-premier-league-shot-statistics" target="_blank">expected goals</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/MC_of_A?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor@MC_of_A" target="_blank">@MC_of_A</a>) by more than any other Premier League team – including league winners Leicester City. An argument can be made about expected goals missing something or its overall accuracy. However, given last year’s decline and the general impression watching West Ham in 2015/16, I’m confident in saying expected goals got it right. It’s also worth noting how weak the Premier League was that season. No top team every really stepped up, leaving the middle sides with more points to be won than usual. Eight teams eventually finished with over 60 points with only Leicester reaching 72+.</p>
<p class="paragraph">So, what would be an indication West Ham have had a good season?</p>
<p class="paragraph">Judging by their inability to break 50 points, I’d suggest that. Obviously fans want more, but aside from 2015/16, the number of teams to break the 50 point mark each season since 2010 are: 7, 9, 9, 7, 9 and 7. Finishing with 50+ points indicates a safe top-half finish - using this as a stepping stone with the goal of stability and eventually pushing for Europa football is not an unrealistic goal.</p>
<p class="heading1">Transfers</p>
<p class="paragraph">One problem with achieving the long-term goal of stability is their short-sighted approach to transfers. Of West Ham’s four proper signings so far; one is a loan, another is a 32 year old, and the other two are approaching 30. The squad also only has five first team players at the age of 26 or younger, which is shocking - only West Brom as fewer. This is fine for the next year or two but unless these players achieve success there are very few able to break through or be sold in order to rebuild.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the short-term I actually think West Ham have had a very good transfer window. Javier Hernandez is an excellent player and could surprise a lot of people now that he’s moved away from the image of being Man United’s sub. He’s a significantly better all-round striker than his reputation suggests – excelling both as a link-up man and runner in behind. Right now Hernandez ranks as the 4th best striker in the Premier League according to JPScore.</p>

<p class="paragraph">JPScore ranked West Ham’s average starting team at 5.04 in 2016/17. This was higher with Payet (6.8) in the first half of the season. Javier Hernandez essentially replaces this loss.</p>
<p class="paragraph">West Ham’s other signings are not as impressive but do improve the best eleven, which in turn improves the squad depth. Joe Hart is an upgrade on their already pretty good goalkeeping options last season. Obviously his reputation isn’t what it used to be, but I find it hard to believe that he isn’t at least a Europa level goalkeeper. Pablo Zabaleta is more of a question mark. He’s definitely not what he was, I’m just not convinced that he’s finished either. If nothing else it’s an upgrade on the mess of a right back situation from last year. Zabaleta currently ranks at 5.2 but is expected to drop to about 4.9 by the end of the season. Marko Arnautovic (5.5) is a solid addition, even if he can be temperamental too. Overall it’s an impressive transfer window if you only take the next two seasons into account.</p>

<p class="heading1">Prediction</p>
<p class="paragraph">It’s West Ham’s second year in their new stadium so the home advantage will probably return slightly. Last season they finished with 7 wins from 19 home games, which was 5th lowest in the league. The squad as a whole looks better now, especially when you consider the sale of Nordveit (4.15) and retirement of Arbeloa (3.85). Bilic is still a manager I’m sceptical of, mistakes seem to repeat and lineup changes seem far too reactionary. At times last season the players seemed to have given up and it’s very rare a Premier League manager survives that nowadays.</p>
<p class="paragraph">JPScore’s pre-season prediction has West Ham finishing 8th with 50 points.</p>
