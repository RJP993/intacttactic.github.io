<p class="heading2">Style of Play</p>
<p class="paragraph">Flair is easy to glorify; as a result fans flood the internet with clips of players performing elaborate skills. Generally it’s the wingers that specialize in these flashy moments that become hyped as the next big thing, before eventually having a frustratingly ineffective career. Pedro is the opposite type of player, and that’s why I think he has been consistently overlooked as a modern great.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The role of every player on the pitch in the most basic sense is to provide value to the team. There’s nothing wrong with being a dribbling winger if it’s effective dribbling. There’s also nothing wrong with not being a dribbling winger, as long as you’re proving value elsewhere. Pedro falls closer to the non-dribbling category but is skilled in tight spaces. Unlike his teammate, Eden Hazard, Pedro is a reactionary dribbler who doesn’t look to instigate a take-on unless it’s required to continue an attack.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In addition to his underlying technical skill, pace and finishing ability, Pedro also demonstrates flawless decision making. In addition, he links play incredibly well in the final 3rd by always providing an option for a wall pass, one-two or through ball and because of this, his teammates are able to easily connect moves. It’s a basic concept, yet very few wide players are capable of consistently providing it in top flight football. Play progression is an underrated element in football, the top players all excel in this area.</p>
<p class="heading2">Intelligence and Movement</p>
<p class="paragraph">I’m a big believer in looking at off-ball contribution when analysing the overall input of a player. It’s strange to me that it’s only players who are extremely bad in this area, such as Mario Balotelli, that get attention. Surely the other end of the scale should be praised?</p>
<p class="paragraph">Regardless of the phase of play, Pedro is always looking to provide value to the team. Making effective runs in behind, dragging defenders out of position on counter attacks, creating passing lanes between the lines, tracking oppositions in defensive phases, initiating presses, and providing the correct movement at the right time – his game intelligence is second to none. It’s these traits that make it no surprise to me that both Barcelona and Chelsea have a greater points return with Pedro than without.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	- Barcelona (2009-15) with Pedro: 2.42 points per game (played 57% of 298 matches)</br>
	- Barcelona (2009-15) w/o Pedro: 2.37 ppg</br>
	- Chelsea (2015-17) with Pedro: 1.91 points per game (played 65% of 82 matches)</br>
	- Chelsea (2015-17) w/o Pedro: 1.86 points per game</br>

<p class="heading1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="paragraph">If improving two of the best sides in the world for your entire career doesn’t make you at least a very good player, then I don’t know what does. Context may be lacking in this example but Pedro also ranked 6th in <a href="https://twitter.com/Goalimpact?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@Goalimpact</a>'s most recent list of the <a href="http://www.goalimpact.com/blog/2016/12/6/top-50-football-players-december-2016" target="_blank">top-50 players in the world</a> and has remained in their top-50 since 2014. Goalimpact is a top-down player rating system looking at the influence each player has on matches by attempting to contextualise their long term impact on their team's goal difference. Pedro’s JPScore is similarly positive, ranking him as the ninth best performer of 2016/17.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">Fundamentally, Pedro's greatest strength is his ability to position himself in the right place at the right time. I cannot stress how often I have watched Pedro deliver a simple tap-in from anticipating the opposition's weakness and stepping off his marker.
<p class="paragraph">At 30 years old it’s likely that ageing will start to kick-in over the next few years. It’ll be a shame if Pedro fails to get the recognition he’s long since deserved before that time.</p>
