<p class="paragraph">I’m not convinced that the performances at the end of 16/17 warranted 9 wins from 10 games. One quick look at the expected goals numbers show that the first six games in the 3-4-2-1 were quite rocky and the eye test agreed. That said, five of these matches were against Man City (N), Leicester (H), Tottenham (A), Man United (H) and Southampton (A). Having to transition from solely 4-2-3-1 for many years also probably wasn’t easy. Form leading into the formation change was poor and likely had some carryover too. Performances in the final games improved - the cup final against Chelsea being Arsenal’s best match since the home 3-0 win to Chelsea in September 2016.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Logically the 3-4-2-1 makes more sense than the 4-2-3-1 for the players at Wenger’s disposal. Game-to-game tactics aren’t a major focus of his; therefore creating a system that covers as many tactical and individual weaknesses as possible will likely give Arsenal their best outcome over a season.</p>
<p class="heading1">Tactical Discussion</p>
<p class="paragraph">One of the constant and major criticisms of Arsenal’s 4-2-3-1 system was the fragile defensive structure. Fullbacks pushed high, attackers had free roles, and one of the two deep midfielders positioned as an extra no.10 in offensive phases, leaving them vulnerable to counter attacks. While the pressing structure is likely to remain problematic under Wenger, the new formation should naturally balance Arsenal’s transitions with the additional central defender.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Arsenal’s personnel in central areas are also likely to benefit from this change.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Ramsey’s lack of positional discipline is less of a factor in front of a back 3, allowing him to focus on his strengths; offensive runs, positional play and penetrative passing. Similarly, Xhaka had a lot of space to cover in the 4-2-3-1 (and Gladbach’s 4-4-2) which I think contributed to his high card count. Shortening that defensive zone and reducing the need for his recovery runs (as 3 at the back formations generally do) should create more of a balanced role for him. Both players looked more comfortable in the closing games of the season.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I’m a big fan of Mertesacker in systems that don’t involve him needing to sprint - the old system definitely wasn’t that. Teams continually set out to isolate him out wide or beat him for pace in the high line. This problem may not be solved but it’ll definitely be helped. Mertesacker will play in the middle of the three (keeping him away from the wide areas) and will be covered for pace by an extra central defender.</p>
<p class="paragraph">If you follow my Twitter you will probably know that I’m not exactly a Mustafi fan. I wrote an <a href="http://intacttactic.co.uk/?shkodran%20mustafi%20good%20bad%20ugly#content" target="_blank">article</a> explaining why prior to the 2016/17 season - to summarise I think he’s a headless chicken with little positional sense. This criticism is less of a factor in a back 3 as holes in the defensive line are more easily covered. I do still think Monreal is the far superior option though and expect him to be first choice LCB.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Ozil and Sanchez have more responsibility in this system as there is one less attacker. It definitely felt like the offensive play revolved around these two more after the formation change and that should be a good thing. Ozil especially thrived in the last 6 weeks of the season. The ball seemed to be moved forward faster and he’s as good as anyone at linking counter attacks.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Removing one attacker does create a new question mark though. Counter attacks could be less effective, possession play trickier to maintain and overall firepower may be lost.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Monreal and Kolasinac are solid wingback options. They make the right runs, link play and defend well. On the other hand, Bellerin and Oxlade-Chamberlain are a bit more questionable. Both are more attacking minded, yet more wasteful. Defensively, too many wingers get the beating of them and their ability to pass forward isn’t Arsenal standard. Bellerin has the fair excuse of age, though I also think he's a bit overrated.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Ox just fails to use his talent effectively. The defenders have all the power when Chamberlain dribbles at them as he has no plan. Show him the corner flag and he’ll run to it every time. Defensively he can’t track a run, position himself properly, or stop a 1-v-1. This career turnaround he’s reportedly having is a myth to me. Being on the ball a lot means nothing if you keep losing it at the end. Right wingback is the weak spot of the starting eleven and no transfer is expected to happen there.</p>

<p class="heading1">Prediction</p>
<p class="paragraph">Competing in the Europa League will impact league form, It always does. Regardless of squad depth and team selection in Europe, it’s still a Thursday match and therefore extra travel, less training and preparation time- and funamentally, more minutes to play.</p> 
<p class="paragraph">Injuries are a given with Arsenal. There’s no point even including Cazorla in any discussions which is a massive shame – form dropped drastically in 16/17 after his injury. There’s bound to be another one or two big losses for chunks of the season too. Right now JPScore ranks Arsenal’s main squad (best 15 players) 3rd in the Premier League and the squad depth (best 23 players) 1st. Injuries should therefore be covered relatively well.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Taking squad quality, squad depth, manager ability, European competitions, squad age and long-term injuries into account sees Arsenal predicted 4th with 71 points ahead of the season.</p>
