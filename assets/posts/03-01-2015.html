        <p class="heading2">Lorca Deportiva (2004-06)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Unai Emery was given his first managerial job at Lorca Deportiva after an injury forced him into early retirement. Lorca's difficult start to the season saw the manager job become available in mid-November. By the end of the season Emery had taken the club to a play-off place, which they won, resulting in the club’s first promotion to the Spanish Second Division in the clubs history. The third division side also knocked Malaga out the Copa Del Rey to take Lorca to the last 16, where they were eliminated by Atletico Madrid. This is the furthest the club has ever reached in the Copa Del Rey.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The first season in the Segunda Division Unai Emery took Lorca to an astonishing 5th place finish – they predicted 2nd from bottom. This achievement saw him offered the Almeria job at the end of the season, which he took. Lorca finished 21st out of 22 and were relegated the year after Emery left. Lorca were founded in 2002 and disbanded in 2012, Emery's 2 years in charge were their 2 most successful. He finished with a 45% win percentage and Marca voted him as the best coach in the division.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Almeria (2006-08)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Almeria finished the 2005/06 season in a disappointing 6th place. With the quality of squad at their disposal promotion was expected and that goal was set to Emery the following year. First season in charge he achieved this with a 2nd place finish despite spending no money and relying on free transfers and loans. Again he was voted best coach in the division by Marca.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2007/08 was Emery's first top flight season. With expectations floating somewhere around relegation, Almeria shot up the league early on and maintained a safe position throughout the year, eventually finishing 8th. A total of £8.5m was spent on transfers, of which £6.5m went on Negredo (22 years old), Diego Alves (22) and Felipe Melo (24). The 07/08 season also saw Almeria equal their best ever Copa Del Rey run, reaching the last 32. Unai Emery left Almeria after 2 seasons with a win percentage of 46.43%.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Valencia (2008-12)</p>

        <p class="paragraph">After four successful years in management, Valencia gave a 36-year-old Unai Emery the chance at a big club. The season before taking over, Valencia won the Copa Del Rey, but with a 10th place finish in the league and failing to get out the Champions League group (finishing bottom below Rosenborg) a managerial change was needed.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">Unai Emery stepped in and had a respectable first season – finishing 6th in the league, reaching the quarter finals of the Copa Del Rey and the last 32 of the UEFA Cup, while again only having limited funds in the transfer market. Before and after the UEFA Cup games, Valencia had an impressive 13-4-6 league record, compared to the 5-4-6 during their UEFA Cup run. During this time Valencia's debt problems grew resulting in many players not being paid. The changes in form unsurprisingly coincided with Valencia's wage payments, before a loan was secured to prevent further problems. It was during the difficult period Valencia were knocked out of the UEFA Cup despite looking very impressive until that point. The financial problems played a huge part in Emery's first season, though signs were positive, especially in the league.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">As a result of the on-going financial problems Valencia were forced to sell £18.5mil worth of players, several being first team players, then only reinvested £4.5mil into the team. Valencia had an incredible season considering the financial uncertainty and turnover in players. Finishing 3rd (only behind Real Madrid and Barcelona) and reaching the Quarter Final of the Europa League (knocked out to eventual winners, Atletico Madrid, on the away goals rule after a 2-2 aggregate draw) saw Emery's reputation grow throughout Spain. Rumours linking the Spaniard with some elite clubs began, however nothing amounted and Emery decided to continue his project at Valencia despite the financial problems.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">The 2010/11 season was quite strange for Valencia in a number of ways. With the financial problems growing by the day, Emery was forced to sell his two biggest assets – David Villa and David Silva. In addition to this, a few other starters, Marchena and Alexis,  joined close rivals. Emery brought in free transfers Sofiane Feghouli and Ricardo Costa, while spending £23m on Soldado, Tino Costa, Mehmet Topal, Aduriz and Jonas. Valencia had made a £50m profit on transfers that transfer window. Emery successfully steadied the ship after large squad turnover; finishing 3rd in the league with a larger margin between them and 4th from the previous season (9 points). Their first Champions League in 3 years saw the Spanish side finish 2nd in the group stage to Man United before being knocked out in the last 16 to Schalke. Valencia were also knocked out in the last 16 of the Copa Del Rey to Villarreal. Given the financial difference between them and the top 2, as well as the quality of players they were forced to sell, it was still an impressive season.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">His final season in charge was in the 2011/12 season. It started very similar to the last with another key player, Juan Mata, being sold. Starters Joaquin and Manuel Fernandes were also sold. Unai Emery, as he'd done in every year at Valencia, spent the limited funds available to build a competitive team. Victor Ruiz, Pablo Piatti, Adil Rami, Dani Parejo and Diego Alves were brought in with Sergio Canales on loan and Paco Alcacer being promoted to the first team. Valencia again finished 3rd in the league behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid. Valencia were knocked out of the Champions League with a 3rd place finish – behind Chelsea (who won it) and Leverkusen, meaning they were placed into the Europa League. They reached the semi-final where they were knocked out by Atletico Madrid (who won it). Valencia also reached the semi-final of the Copa Del Rey where they were knocked out to Barcelona (yes, they also won it). At the end of the year Emery decided to leave having taken Valencia as far as he thought they could go under him. Unai Emery ended his 4-year spell with a record of 107-58-55 in all competitions (48.64% win percentage) scoring 385 and conceding 262.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Spartak Moscow 2012</p>
    
        <p class="paragraph">After 8 consecutive successful years in Spain, Emery moved to Russia to manage Spartak Moscow. Spartak had just finished 4th in the league. The year Emery took over the competition for the top places grew with Anzhi wildly spending on a few big names, as well as Zenit, CSKA and Rubin investing reasonably big. Unai Emery was sacked just over half way into the season with a league record 9-2-6 – 1.71 points per game. The following 13 games Spartak's league record was 6-4-3 – 1.69 points per game. Spartak were knocked out of the Russian Cup in the last 16 on penalties to Rostov, which was a huge part of Emery's sacking. Spartak were also knocked out of a tough Champions League group including Barcelona and Benfica. Ultimately his time there was short and unsuccessful.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Sevilla 2013-</p>

        <p class="paragraph">After finishing 9th in 2012/13, Sevilla brought in Unai Emery to help the club meet their growing expectations. The season started similar to several at Valencia with a huge turnover of players, including many of Sevilla's key men – Negrado, Navas, Kondogbia, Medel, Spahic and Luis Alberto, as well as 8 others released or sold for a total of £80m. Sevilla invested £30m back into the team with Emery signing Gameiro, Bacca, Vitolo, Iborra, Beto and Carrico. Sevilla finished the 2013/14 season as Europa League Champions and 5th place in La Liga. An unbelievable season considering the players they lost and what happened the season before.</p>

        <div class="imageWrapper">
            <img class="image" src="assets/postImages/negrado-navas.png" />
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">As of right now, 16 league games into the 2014/15 season, Emery's Sevilla sit 4th. Valencia, his old club, are the closest opposition and have had a strong start to the season. Sevilla again made a profit on transfers (£25m) with Moreno, Rakitic and Fazio making up most of the revenue. Krychowiak, Aleix Vidal, Ever Banega, Tremoulinas, Pareja and Mbia were signed as their replacements. Sevilla are currently in the last 16 of the Copa Del Rey having won their first tie 11-2 on aggregate – they face Granada next. Sevilla unfortunately missed out on Champions League football as the rule for Europa League winners qualifying for the Champions League began the year after. Sevilla are now in the last 32 of the Europa where they face Lucien Favre's Gladbach. Given the quality of the 2 managers, it's hard to imagine either being stuck in charge of many Europa League ties in a few years time.</p>

        <p class="heading2">Summary</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Unai Emery hasn't got a huge collections of trophies like some managers in Europe, but what he does offer is an ability to consistently surpass expectations. The clubs he's managed haven't been expected to win trophies, though if you take out the elite, he's often finished in the next available league place (especially at Valencia with three 3rd place finishes in four years).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">His style of play, while not massively exciting tactically, is incredibly well thought out and organised. His teams are always flexible, mostly a 4-2-3-1, but there are always tweaks to suit both what he has at his disposal and to take advantage of the opposition. Unai Emery is an obsessive perfectionist and I have no doubts that whatever top club gives him his chance won't regret it. Success follows him from club-to-club.</p>
