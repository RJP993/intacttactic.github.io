<p class="heading1">Betting</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Betting page is now up and running!</p>
<p class="paragraph">Bets are selected based on the JPScore probability compared to Bet365’s odds. I’ve always found team selections to be an area that betting markets can’t/don’t adapt well to, therefore this is the main influence on my outcome probability. Other factors such as home advantage, form, pace in attack and whether a team is offensive or defensive are taken into account to improve accuracy.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The bets are selected based on where the value is in the odds, NOT the mostly likely outcome. As a result the stake provided should be used as a guide to help maximise the long term return if you do decide on using the tips.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Premier League and Bundesliga will be the only two leagues bet on for the first season. Both leagues have been tested on for about a year now and generally I’ve covered their teams more regularly than Spanish or Italian teams. If things go well another league will be added next season.</p>
<p class="paragraph">As much as anything else I like the idea of publicly putting the player ratings against the bookies to test their accuracy.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Anyway, hopefully it goes well. If you are going to use the betting section for tips I advise you read the disclaimer at the bottom of the site and accept that I won't always be right.</p>
<p class="heading1">Players</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Players page will be changing quite drastically within the next few weeks. Instead of occasional write-ups on individuals, the Players page will instead contain a list of players with their JPScore rating over time and their predicted peak.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Originally, as mentioned in <a href="intacttactic.co.uk/?d=11-08-2017#c" target="_blank">this post</a>, the goal was to be a go-to source for people looking to see how good/bad a player is. Realistically this isn’t possible if each player needs a detailed write-up – there just isn’t enough time for it. There will still be occasional write-ups on players, however they will now be within the write-up section.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Approaching the player page this way allows me to cover more players, take requests, add more content and meet the initial goal. Similar to the betting page, I like the idea of putting my ratings out there to see how accurate I am over time. In general I just think this page will prove more interesting as a quick source for scouted players - especially the lesser known ones your club has just signed.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Here’s an example of how the charts will look:</p>
